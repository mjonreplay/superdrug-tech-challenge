# Superdrug Front-End Technical Challenge -  Matthew Jackson

This is a hot drinks machine for the Superdrug Front End Technical Challenge

The primary goal of this exercise is to assess how you reason about your ability to write well defined HTML, CSS and Javascript using the latest patterns and technologies.

You are required to model the operation of a hot drinks machine. Based on the selection of a customer you will be required to make a drink according to a recipe for each choice.

# Notes
 - Design based on a really rough hot drinks selection touch screen interface.
 - CSS without pre-processor (unclear if this was allowed i.e. SASS, LESS)
 - Step durations may be non realistic and sped up for development.
 - Prefer sugar / milk to be an optional added step?
 - Used grunt for this task but use gulp more often.
 - Used github for this task but use bitbucket more often.
 - There are many areas that could be extended / improved if more time is granted.
